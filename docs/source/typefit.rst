Fitting data into types
=======================

The base feature of typefit is to fit data into Python data structures. By
example:

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import NamedTuple, Text
    from typefit import typefit


    class Item(NamedTuple):
        id: int
        title: Text


    item = typefit(Item, {"id": 42, "title": "Item title yay"})
    assert item.title == "Item title yay"

It will use typing annotations in order to understand what kind of data
structure you expect and then it will create an instance of the specified type
based on the provided data.

Fitting Enum
----------------

Typefit can also be used to fit data to an `Enum`.

.. code-block:: python

    from typefit import typefit

    class Color(Enum):
        RED = 1
        GREEN = 2
        BLUE = 3

    item = typefit(Color, 2)
    assert item == Color.GREEN

typefit will return the attribute of the enum class if the value is valid or else
it will raise a `ValueError` exception.

Fitting mappings
----------------

The concept is as simple as that but it can become pretty powerful. Firstly,
typing definitions can be recursive, so this would work:

.. code-block:: python

    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from typing import List, Text
    from typefit import typefit


    @dataclass
    class Comment:
        text: Text
        children: List["Comment"] = field(default_factory=list)


    data = {
        "text": "Hello",
        "children": [
            {
                "text": "Howdy",
            },
            {
                "text": "Hello to you too",
            },
        ]
    }

    comment = typefit(Comment, data)

You'll notice that we switched from :class:`typing.NamedTuple` to a
`dataclass`. Both approaches work, that's up to you to decide which fits your
needs most.

.. note::

   This example uses a forward reference as type because the :class:`Comment`
   is not defined at the time we need it. This means that Python will have to
   be able to resolve this reference later, meaning that this class has to be
   importable. If hidden inside a 2-nd order function it won't work.

Parsing narrow types
--------------------

This system also allows you to parse input and coerce it into a more pythonic
object. A typical example for that would be to parse a date. Typefit uses
:code:`pendulum` in order to parse dates and will return a Pendulum date time
object.

.. code-block:: python

    from typefit import narrows, typefit

    data = "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    date = typefit(narrows.DateTime, data)

    assert date.month == 1

.. note::

    Date narrow types depend on the ``pendulum`` package, however Typefit
    doesn't list it as a dependency. If you want to be able to use those, you
    need to install ``pendulum`` for your project.

Narrows are types that will help narrow-down the data you are parsing to a
Python function. Of course, you might not want to limit yourself to builtin
narrow types.

Custom type
+++++++++++

You can provide a custom narrow type simply by creating a type whose
constructor will have exactly a single argument which is properly annotated
(with a simple type like ``int`` or ``Text`` but not a generic like ``Union``
or ``List``).

.. code-block:: python

    from typing import Text
    from typefit import typefit

    class Name:
        def __init__(self, full_name: Text):
            split = full_name.split(' ')

            if len(split) != 2:
                raise ValueError('Too many names')

            self.first_name, self.last_name = split

    name = typefit(Name, "RÃ©my Sanchez")
    print(name.first_name)
    print(name.last_name)

Wrapper type
++++++++++++

However sometimes you just want to wrap a type that already exists but doesn't
have the right arguments in its constructor. That's the case of the
date-related narrows described above. Let's dissect one.

.. code-block:: python

    import pendulum

    class TimeStamp(pendulum.DateTime):
        def __new__(cls, date: int):
            return pendulum.from_timestamp(date)

You'll probably ask why is there some funny business with ``__new__`` instead
of just created a function that will parse and return the desired value. The
answer is that you're doing type annotations so you must provide valid types
otherwise you'll confuse your static type checker, which loses the interest of
annotating types in a first place.

Config
------

`typefit` function takes an optional third argument of type `typefit.Config`.
Config class provides attributes to control the behavior of `typefit` function.

Strict Mode
+++++++++++

When fitting the data to `NamedTuple` for `dataclass` the default behavior is to
ignore any extra key in the data which is not part of type class. We can control
this behavior using the `strict_mapping` attribute of `Config` class.

.. code-block:: python

    from pytest import raises

    from typefit import typefit, Config

    class Item(NamedTuple):
        id: int
        title: str
        versions: List[int]

    data = {
        'id': 1,
        'title': 'Data 1',
        'versions': [1, 2, 3]
    }

    config = Config(strict_mapping=True)

    assert typefit(Item, data, config=config) == Item(data1)

    # Adding an key not in Item class
    data['newkey'] = 'newValue'

    # Will raise an ValueError
    with raises(ValueError):
        assert typefit(Item, data, config=config)


Reference
---------

You'll find here the reference of the public API. Private function are
documented in the source code but might change or disappear without notice.
The current API is not stable but will try to change as little as possible
before version 1.

Typefit
+++++++

The core typefit module only exposes one function.

.. autofunction:: typefit.typefit

Narrows
+++++++

Narrows are data types that integrate some form of parsing to generate Python
objects from more generic types like strings. All those classes accept exactly
one argument to their constructor which is the data structure to convert.

.. automodule:: typefit.narrows
